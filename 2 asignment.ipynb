    "#       the central tendency (e.g., mean or median). Here's an explanation of each measure and an example:\n",

    "# Range:\n",
    "# The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values\n",

    "# Range = Maximum value - Minimum value\n",
    "# Example: Consider a dataset of exam scores for a class of students. If the highest score is 95 and the lowest score is 60,\n",
    "# the range of scores is 95 - 60 = 35.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Variance:\n",
    "# Variance quantifies how much individual data points deviate from the mean (average). It is calculated by taking the average\n",
    "# of the squared differences between each data point and the mean.\n",
    "# Variance = (Σ(xi - μ)²) / N, where xi represents data points, μ is the mean, and N is the number of data points.\n",
    "# Example: Suppose you have a dataset of daily temperatures for a week, and the mean temperature is 75°F. The variance is\n",
    "# calculated by summing the squared differences between each day's temperature and 75, then dividing by the number of days.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Standard Deviation:\n",
    "# The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of the average deviation of data points\n",
    "# from the mean. It is often preferred over variance because it is in the same units as the data.\n",
    "# Standard Deviation = √Variance\n",
    "# Example: Using the same dataset of daily temperatures, if the variance is calculated to be 25 square degrees (Fahrenheit),\n",
    "# the standard deviation is √25 = 5°F.\n",

    "# Range:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Range = 92 (max) - 75 (min) = 17\n",
    "# Variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calculate the mean: (85 + 90 + 75 + 88 + 92) / 5 = 88\n",
    "# Variance = [(85-88)² + (90-88)² + (75-88)² + (88-88)² + (92-88)²] / 5\n",
    "# Variance = (9 + 4 + 169 + 0 + 16) / 5 = 198 / 5 = 39.6\n",
    "# Standard Deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Standard Deviation = √Variance = √39.6 ≈ 6.30\n",
    "\n",
    "# So, in this example, the range is 17, the variance is approximately 39.6, and the standard deviation is approximately 6.30.\n",

    "# Covariance can be positive, negative, or zero. A positive covariance suggests that when one variable increases, the other\n",
    "# tends to increase as well. A negative covariance suggests that when one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.\n",

    "# 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship.\n",
    "# The most commonly used measure of correlation is the Pearson correlation coefficient, denoted as \"r.\" It is defined as:\n",

    "# QUESTION.12 For a normal distribution data what is the relationship between its measure of central tendency?\n",
    "\n",
    "# ANSWER For a normal distribution, which is a symmetric probability distribution, the measures of central tendency are \n",
    "# related as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mean (μ): The mean of a normal distribution is also its median. This means that the center of the distribution, as\n",
    "# indicated by the mean, is also the point around which the data is symmetrically distributed. In a perfectly symmetrical\n",
    "# normal distribution, the mean is located at the peak of the distribution, and it divides the data into two equal halves.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Median: The median of a normal distribution is equal to its mean. This is a consequence of the symmetry of the normal\n",
    "# distribution. The median is the value that separates the lower 50% of the data from the upper 50%, and in a normal\n",
    "# distribution, this value coincides with the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mode: The mode of a normal distribution is also equal to the mean and median. In a perfectly symmetric normal distribution,\n",
    "# there is only one peak (unimodal), and this peak corresponds to the mean. In other words, the mode is the value with the\n",
    "# highest frequency of occurrence in the distribution, and in a normal distribution, it is at the center of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# So, in a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all the same value, and they represent the center of the\n",
    "# distribution. This is a unique property of the normal distribution, and it's a result of its symmetric bell-shaped curve.\n"

    "# QUESTION.13 How is covariance different from correlation?\n",
    "# ANSWER \n",
    "# Covariance and correlation are both measures that describe the relationship between two random variables, but they have\n",
    "# different interpretations and scales. Here are the key differences between covariance and correlation:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Covariance: Covariance is a measure of the degree to which two random variables change together. It quantifies the extent\n",
    "# to which they move in the same direction. It is calculated by taking the average of the product of the deviations of each\n",
    "# variable from their respective means.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Correlation: Correlation is a standardized measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two\n",
    "# variables. It provides information about both the strength and direction of the association. Correlation is calculated by\n",
    "# dividing the covariance by the product of the standard deviations of the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Scale:\n",
    "# Covariance can take on any real value and can be positive, negative, or zero. The magnitude of covariance is not \n",
    "# standardized, so it is challenging to interpret the strength of the relationship from its value alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Correlation, on the other hand, always ranges between -1 and 1. A correlation of +1 indicates a perfect positive linear\n",
    "# relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship. Correlation\n",
    "# values have a standardized scale, making it easier to compare and interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Interpretation:\n",
    "# Covariance does not provide a clear indication of the strength or direction of the relationship between variables, as\n",
    "# its magnitude depends on the scales of the variables. Therefore, it is often difficult to compare covariances between\n",
    "# different pairs of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Correlation is more interpretable and useful for comparing the relationships between different pairs of variables, as \n",
    "# it standardizes the measure and provides a clear indication of the strength (absolute value) and direction (sign) of \n",
    "# the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Units:\n",
    "# Covariance is measured in the units of the product of the two variables, which can make it difficult to interpret when \n",
    "# the variables have different units.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Correlation is a unitless measure, as it standardizes the values of the variables by dividing by their standard deviations.\n",
    "# This makes it easier to compare and interpret without being affected by the units of measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In summary, covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together, but it lacks standardization and can\n",
    "# be challenging to interpret. Correlation, on the other hand, is a standardized measure that provides a clear indication\n",
    "# of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, making it a more widely used and\n",

    "# In the previous example, the range increases significantly due to the outlier (90 - 10 = 80).\n",
    "\n",
    "# b. Variance and Standard Deviation: Outliers can inflate the variance and standard deviation, as these measures are based\n",
    "# on the differences between data points and the mean. Outliers are treated as deviations from the mean and can lead to \n",

    "Visual inspection: Plotting your data using graphs like box plots or histograms can help you identify outliers.\n",
    "Removal: You can choose to remove outliers from the dataset if they are due to errors or anomalies.\n",
    "Transformation: Applying data transformations like the log transformation can reduce the impact of outliers on the mean \n",

    "Robust statistics: Using robust statistical measures like the median and interquartile range (IQR) can help mitigate the\n",
